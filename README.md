# Killers.cc UPDATED Src 
Note:

The .dylib and other stuff is in the LEAK.ZIP

The legit aa is in the "semilegit" cfg.

To turn it on other configs Enable yaw and set it to Jitter.

The "Legit AA" tickbox does not do anything.

If You go to Thirdperson, make sure to enable Real Angles to see Your "Fake".(Your player model is what the enemy see's on their screen.)

Resolver dosen't work.(Maybe)

The cfg "Save" button dosen't save the:Local Cham Color, Manual aa for some of the cfg's, Color for some of the visual options.

Manual AA dosen't work with Legit AA ;(
