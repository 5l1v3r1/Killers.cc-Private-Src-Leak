# Killers.cc Premuim "Leak"
Notes:

•The .dylib and other stuff is in the LEAK.ZIP

•The legit aa is in the "semilegit" cfg.

•To turn it on other configs Enable yaw and set it to Jitter.

•The "Legit AA" tickbox does not do anything.

•If Your Chams are black go to Video settings, and set Your Shaders to HIGH.

•DON'T put the configs in the Killers folder, put them in the cfg folder.(Put it in Desktop, Along with KIllers.)

•If You go to Thirdperson, make sure to enable Real Angles to see Your "Fake".(Your player model is what the enemy see's on their screen.)

•Resolver dosen't work.

•The cfg "Save" button dosen't save the: Local Cham Color, Manual aa for some of the cfg's, Color for some of the visual options, 

•Manual AA dosen't work with Legit AA ;(

•Legit Bot's fixed.(Maybe)

•Put the CFG Folder on Your Desktop along with the KIllers folder (The configs are mine, just change em up)

•Legit AA is absolutely Dogshit.

•Once You open the menu You have to press Esc to enable/disable stuff.

•To change the Local Player Cham color You have to navigate to the Colors tab and find "TP colors".


•Will this get updated?. No.
•However I will post updates if I do find any updates.


See ya nerds.
ALso please don't sell this lmao.
